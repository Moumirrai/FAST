# **2. Gender**

* xxWe want to be as inclusive as possible, so we try to be neutral, but we use gender-specific nouns and verbs if remaining neutral goes against the writing best practices for a specific language.
* xxBasic principles:
  * xxWhen possible, avoid the use of masculine singular form to refer to someone whose gender is unknown.
  * xxDon’t suggest the reader’s gender using a specific grammatical forms. If you cannot use forms that are gender-free, rephrase the sentence.

|English|We avoid|We prefer|
| --- | --- | --- |
|I am happy to help you.|xx.|xx|
|If you are interested in Proton Mail…|xx|xx|
|I am not used to this tool.|xx|xx|

* xxYou can use passive language to avoid gender-specific verbs, but only if it doesn’t hurt readability and/or make the sentence sound unnatural.
* xxApply the masculine form when an adjective, verb, or another part of speech refers to multiple nouns with different genders.
* xxRephrase when you are unable to find a gender-neutral way.

:warning: The gender and number of the acronym are determined by the gender and number of the translation for the governing noun of the extended form. Here is an example: VPN (Virtual Personal Network) is xx because the translation of “network” (“réseau”) is xx.

# **3. Abbreviations**

**Whenever possible, avoid using abbreviations**.

Abbreviate the text only when you lack space (mainly buttons, option names or strings with specific character limitations) or when you need to ease the text readibility. Instead of abbreviating (e.g., 4 or 5 consecutive words), summarize a term or a phrase in 2 or 3 words that can be written in full.

General criteria for shortening words:

* xxOmit at least two letters
* xxTruncate a word so that it ends with a consonant and place a period after it
* xxWhen a word contains a double consonant, truncate it at the second one and place a period after it
* Examples:
  * Transcription :point_right: xx
  * Collection :point_right: xx

**Days abbreviations** (in calendars, agendas, timetables… the names of days are written without a period for visual purposes):

|English|Translation|Abbreviation|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Monday|xx|xx|
|Tuesday|xx|xx|
|Wednesday|xx|xx|
|Thursday|xx|xx|
|Friday|xx|xx|
|Saturday|xx|xx|
|Sunday|xx|xx|

**Months abbreviations** (in calendars, agendas, timetables… the names of months are written without a period for visual purposes):

|English|Translation|Abbreviation|
| --- | --- | --- |
|January|xx|xx|

# **4. Acronyms**

* Common examples are VPN (Virtual Personal Network), DNS (Domain Name Server), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), etc.
* The most common acronyms and their translations are included in the glossary. Always refer to the glossary when localizing acronyms.
* The gender and number of the acronym are determined by the gender and number of the translation for the main noun of the extended form.
:point_right: API (Application Programming Interface) is xx because the translation of “interface” (“interface”) is xx.
* xxTo choose the appropriate article to use in front of an acronym, consider the gender and the euphonic effect.
The API :point_right: xx
* Commonly used acronyms do not need explanations (DVD, LED, TV, etc.).
* When an acronym is repeated several times in the same section, include its extended form in parentheses only for its first occurrence.

# **5. Pronouns**

* English, especially technical English, is more redundant than some other languages.
* xxWhen translating, you often need to reduce the redundancy of the source text using pronouns. This may otherwise affect the text readability. However, this must not affect accuracy.
* When translating technical and complex strings, ensure users can associate pronouns to the noun they refer to.
* Avoid the use of possessive pronouns when possible.
* Omit pronoun subjects such as “we” and “you".

# **6. Gerunds (“ing” ending)**

* Gerunds are used in English, such as in “Creating a report”.
* xxWhen paragraph and chapter heads begin in English with a gerund, as a general rule please use an infinitive, translating it as the equivalent of “Create a report”.
* Depending on the context, this may also mean “in the process of”.

# **7. Punctuation**

If you need help, you can check this website.

## 7.1 Period

* For the period at the end of a sentence (subject + verb), adapt the source to your language usage:
  * When the English source does not put a period at the end of the sentence (subject + verb), but should in your language, add it in your translation. **In this case, make sure that the text you are translating is not a part of a longer sentence (this is usually specified in the context).**
  * “An error occurred while communicating with the extension” :point_right: xx
* xxInclude a period at the end of each extended sentence in a bullet list if this sentence has a full meaning by itself.
* xxUnless the item includes more than one sentence, do not place any periods at the end of titles, links, buttons and checkboxes.

## 7.2 Exclamation mark

* Exclamation marks are used to give emphasis.
* xxAs their use is less common than in English, you should use them sparingly: feel free to change an exclamation mark into a period if it is more natural, but please don’t change a period into an exclamation mark.

|English|We avoid|We prefer|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Theme reset! Redirecting…|xx.|xx|
|Importing contacts complete!|xx|xx|

## 7.3 Parentheses

* Parentheses are used to clarify statements or provide additional information.
* xxLet’s avoid parentheses as much as possible and adapt to the context.

|English|We avoid|We prefer|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Please choose a display name to finish setting up your account. (Other people will see this.)|xx|xx|
|We also support importing vCard. (UTF-8 encoding)|xx|xx|

## 7.4 Comma

|You can also add, delete, and edit them by clicking…|xx|xx|
|Assign permissions to users, or groups|xx|xx|

## 7.5 Colon and semicolon

* xxColons and semicolons are all preceded by a non-breaking space.
* xxThere is no capital letter starting the word that follows the semicolon.
Date: Old to new :point_right: xx

## 7.6 Em dash (—), en dash (–), hyphen (-)

* In English, an Em or En dash is used to demarcate an isolated element, to introduce an item that is not essential to the sentence’s meaning, to emphasize a sudden change in thought or to bring focus to a list.
* xxIt is often more appropriate to use a comma, a full stop or parenthesis instead.
* xxAlso, the Em dash is not used for date ranges, therefore you should use “xx” instead.
September 10 - 20 :point_right: xx

## 7.7 Quotation marks

* xxUse these xx quotation marks.
* Place the period outside the closing quotation mark.

## 7.8 Apostrophes

xxUse straight apostrophes :point_right: xx

## 7.9 Ampersand (&)

# **8 Spacing and non-breaking spaces**

* xxUse non-breaking spaces to prevent improper division of elements such as product names, part numbers, numbers, dates, etc.
* xxWhen using currency symbols or units of measurement, include a non-breaking space between number and sign.
* To insert a non-breaking space using your keyboard:
  * On Windows, hold down the “Alt” key while typing the number “255”.

# **15 Foreign words**

* The decision about the use of foreign words (keeping it in English) rather than an equivalent term in your language is based on how widespread the use of the word is. An English term might be recommended when its use has become very common.
* To find out how common a word is, you can use internet search engines. Search for the English word and for the corresponding translation in your language on your preferred search engine. The number of occurrences in each case will be an indication of how popular the use of each word is. If in doubt for an important term, ask Proton Localization team to make an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) check.
* xxForeign words might be accompanied by quotation marks or italics when their use is not widely spread. However, English words that are widely accepted for use are kept as they are in the original but do not take the ending “s” in the plural case.
* When foreign words are common and well understood, they can be left in the source language. Where necessary, add an explanation in the target language.
* xxAvoid using too many anglicisms.
